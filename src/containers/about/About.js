        I am a Full Stack Software Developer, proficient in JavaScript, NodeJS,
        React, Express, SQL, and MongoDB. I specialize in problem solving and
        delivering elegant solutions for complex technological needs. My time in
        the armed forces taught me the importance of teamwork and clear
        communication, and instilled in me the belief that one should leave all
        things in better condition than they were found. Iâ€™m an open
        communicator who values transparency and accountability.
